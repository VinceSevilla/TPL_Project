# Mini Compiler 
It is a Java-based compiler that focuses on analyzing Java variable declarations. The compiler goes through three phases: 

- Lexical Analysis: Checks if variable declarations match expected types and have no invalid tokens
- Syntax Analysis: Ensures variable declarations are syntactically correct and properly formatted
- Semantic Analysis: Validates that variables are used with correct types and consistent values

Each phase checks different aspects of the code to ensure it is valid and well-formed.
